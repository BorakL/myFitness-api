          "Your biceps brachii has two heads: short (inner) and long (outer). The long head makes up the majority of the biceps’ peak, whereas the short head sits on the inner side and contributes to the biceps’ width. The close-grip EZ bar curl will emphasize the long head and build the peak of your biceps. The wide-grip EZ bar curl will emphasize the short head and give your biceps more width. The standard (shoulder-width) EZ bar curl will place approximately equal emphasis on both heads.",
          "An easy way to remember whether you’re working the short/inner or long/outer head of the biceps brachii is to look in the mirror. When using a close grip, which, as explained above, targets the long head, the long head will be visible. When using a wide grip, which targets the short head, the short head will be visible."

Therefore, some instructors advise that you supinate early on the way up and return to neutral grip late on the way down. This, they argue, ensures that you keep the tension on the biceps instead of the brachioradialis. However, others argue that if you supinate gradually, as described above, the supination has to fight against more gravitational resistance, thus making the biceps work harder."

You sit on them, grasp the handles over your shoulders, and crunch by flexing your waist and pulling the handles down. Still other ab machines allow you to crunch your waist and flex your hips at the same time (see the machine leg raise crunch). Whatever the design of the ab machine, make sure that you adjust the seat and foot pads for optimal support, leverage, comfort, safety, and range of motion."

To learn safe progression, watch the first video.",

The seated barbell twist is one exercise you can use to strengthen the twisting primal movement pattern of your body."
