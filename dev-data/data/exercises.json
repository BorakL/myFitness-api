When pronated or in neutral grip, your brachioradialis is the primary elbow flexor. Therefore, some instructors advise that you supinate early on the way up and return to neutral grip late on the way down. This, they argue, ensures that you keep the tension on the biceps instead of the brachioradialis. However, others argue that if you supinate gradually, as described above, the supination has to fight against more gravitational resistance, thus making the biceps work harder.",

  "tips": "To avoid injuring your back, keep the movement slow and controlled. Do not allow momentum to build up./nKeep your hips and knees flexed at 90-degree angles./nThe lying bent-knee oblique twist can be performed with your calves resting on an exercise ball, in which case the ball will roll and guide your legs down in a smooth circular motion./nMake the exercise more difficult by holding a stability ball between your bent legs (see second video). You can also just straighten your legs (lying oblique twist; see third video).",

  "equipment": "bar",
  "tips": "Keep the movement slow and under full control. Do not allow momentum to build up because you can damage your spine./nAvoid using heavy weights because the momentum may become too difficult to control. Even an Olympic bar might be too heavy for this exercise. Many people just use a broomstick./nWhile you don’t have to stop midway between each twist—most people don’t—you should at least slow down. This not only reduces the amount of momentum that can build up but also makes your obliques work harder./nAs explained in Guidelines and principles of weight training, your body’s ability to twist is one of its seven primal movement patterns, and all primal movement patterns should be strengthened. The seated barbell twist is one exercise you can use to strengthen the twisting primal movement pattern of your body.",

  "tips": "Make sure that you’re not just raising your knees. After raising your knees, you must also flex your abdomen to raise your knees even higher. If you do not flex your abdomen, your abs and obliques will only function as stabilizers./nKeep your lower back as straight as possible throughout the exercise. The exercise is best performed with your lower back pressed against a padded surface for support (see video). Instead of hanging from a bar with an unsupported lower back, use a captain’s chair if one is available./nThe hanging leg and hip raise is essentially the same as the captain’s chair leg and hip raise, an exercise that, in one classic study, was found to be the most effective at activating the obliques and the second most effective at activating the abs./nTo make the hanging leg and hip raise exercise easier, perform it lying on your back (lying leg and hip raise).",

If this is difficult for you, place your hands under your buttocks. This will help to straighten your lower back as well as support your pelvis. See video./nIn one study by the American Council on Exercise (ACE), compared with the traditional crunch, the reverse crunch was found to produce 9% more mean activity in the rectus abdominis and 140% more mean activity in the obliques./nIt is a myth that the reverse crunch works your lower rectus abdominis and the traditional crunch works your upper rectus abdominis. Your rectus abdominis is a single muscle that contracts in its entirety irrespective of the type of crunch that you perform. It is not possible to isolate a specific section of the muscle.",
